# Associative-MAPS-using-AVL-TREES
## Associative Maps: 
Associative Maps or Tree Maps are an important data structure that have many uses in real-world. Conceptually, Map is a data structure that consists of are collection of key and value pairs. In a map, the key values are generally used to sort and uniquely identify the elements, while the mapped values store the content associated to this key.

## Functioanlities
a) Insert: Provide Recursive Insert function. The Insert function will insert a given value in AVL MAP. Incase value already exist then it should return false and do not insert.
